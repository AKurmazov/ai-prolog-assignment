# Running instructions

If you want to run the solution in the online swi prolog compiler, then comment the very last row in solution.pl: `halt(0).`

If you have the compiler on your machine, then simply run it via `swipl solution.pl`, and then start the program inside the swi-environment: `test.`

Please be awere that backtracking might take long to complete.

# Providing input

You can insert your predicates directly in code, but do not forget to comment generating functions in the test function
